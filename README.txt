TODO:
- Add caret to node menu showing whether or not it has children
- increase debounce frequency
- make menu drawing more efficient (fewer complete refreshes)
- fix timeout so that it remembers state and returns to the dash (not just one level back up)
- display primary teensy's current state (in FSM) by reading state changes off the CAN bus. Add this to dash state, tft[1] (the 2nd one)
